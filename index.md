### CPSC 120

* Lab 4 
    Lab 4 part 2 was one of my favorite labs because it was the first lab where I completed without the help of the teacher or an outside tutor. I wrote a code about a number guessing game where one player chooses a number and the second player would get two tries to guess the player's number. My code could also player two if their guess was too high or too low of the secret number. 

* Lab 6
    Lab 6 part 1 was another one of my favorite labs because it helped me understand vectors better. I wrote a code that would make different sandwich orders when players filled in the blanks from each category. 

* Lab 11
    Lab 11 part 2 is my favorite lab because it was like a continuation of lab 4 part 2 but with a challenge. Here, again, I wrote a code about guessing a number. The challenge was instigating a random number the program would choose and the player would guess.
